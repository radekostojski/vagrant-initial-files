# Initial configuration files for Vagrant

This is replacement I'm using for standard configuration generated by *vagrant init*

It's support multiple vm or single vm. Copy to your Vagrant directory and modify according to needs.

## Files
* Vagrantfile-multinode
    support multiple VM, where configuration is store in array.
* Vagrantfile-singlenode
    single VM with simplified configuration stored in variables.
* ssh-config
    template for .ssh/config to help ssh from any directory, bypass of *vagrant ssh*

## TODO list
1. Custom init script
2. Integrate init script with dotfiles
3. Work out other settings
4. Better network management around multiple VMs
5. Plugins like: AWS and OpenStack
