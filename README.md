# Initial configuration files for Vagrant

This is replacement I'm using for standard configuration generated by *vagrant init*

It's support multiple vm or single vm. Copy to your Vagrant directory and modify according to needs.


## TODO list
1. Custom init script
2. integrate init script with dotfiles
3. Work out other settings
4. Better network management around multiple VMs
